# August 25th: Made the actual card!!

I first learnt how to use EasyEDA. Then i followed the instructions and learnt to create the schematic. Also spent a lot of time scratching my head over the datasheet. Then went to the convert it into PCB and then designing into a cutesy little thing. Still wanna do more designing on it for friends and stuff
